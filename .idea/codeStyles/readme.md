This code style is based on the [Google Java code style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml).

These changes are to meet [CodeRead requirements](https://confluence.devfactory.com/display/CodeReview/Setting+Up+Code+Review+Compliant+IDE+Style):
* Max line length is 120 (from 100)
* Tab size 4 (from 2)
* Ident is 4 (from 2)
* Continuation indent is 8 (from 4)

These changes are to enforce the standard:
* Disable detect and use existing file indents for editing
* Disable EditorConfig support
